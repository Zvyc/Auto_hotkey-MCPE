This is a program that allows you to move things around in your inventory and chest by hovering it and pressing its desired location, just like you can in Minecraft Java Edition.

To run this program you have to have python3 and the packages:

	* pyautogui
	* pynput
	* autoit

If you don't know how to install these things, look up tutorials online

If you want to use my default settings, you have to play in fullscreen and have the
"GUI Scale Modifier" set to "-1" in the Minecraft Settings.
(Might need to have a screen with the resolution 1920x1080 aswell but I don't know)

You can also use your own settings if you calibrate the script to your settings.

If you want to use your own settings then you are going to run the file "setup.py".

If you look at the image file I've provided: "calibrate_mouse_position.jpg", it will show where you are supposed to put your cursor when running the file "setup.py".

A step by step guide that will guide you through the setup process:

	* First open the image "calibrate_mouse_position.jpg" and look at where the red circle is placed
	* Run the script "setup.py"
	* Move your cursor over to your own minecraft client and hover the place
	  where the red circle was placed in the picture
	* Press the key "y" while your cursor is in the area where the red circle were(doesn't need to be exact)
	* And you're done!

If you want to play the game rezised or in another configuration you have to go through the setup process again
